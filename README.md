# Predicting Quantities using Random Forest - Python
Predicting Quantities with Random Forest Regression for the dateset "Google Store Ecommerce Data + Fake Retail Data"


**About the Dataset**
- We will download the dataset [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/jpallard/google-store-ecommerce-data-fake-retail-data).
- This dataset contains Google Store Ecommerce data from Jan 01, 2017 to Dec 31, 2017.
- This dataset contains following csv files and are as follows:
      - Key_SKU.csv
      - Marketing_Spend.csv
      - Online.csv
      - Retail.csv

We will try to forecast a time series data by running regression models with Python, and inspect their results. 

Models we will use are as follows: 

- [x] **Linear Regression**
- [x] **Lasso**
- [x] **Decision Tree Regressor**
- [x] **Random Forest Regressor**
- [x] **K-Neighbors Regressor**
      

**Other Details:**

   - **Operating System:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
   - **Programming language:** Python3.6
   - **Python programming library version**
       - Tensorflow: 1.14.0
       - Keras: 2.3.1
       - Matplotlib: 3.2.2
       - Plotly: 4.8.2
       - Seaborn: 0.10.1
       - Sklearn 0.0

**Note:** 
  - Do not forget they are just quick and basic predictions so we can improve these models with tuning and according to availability of the dataset and business    requirements.
  - During next update, let's try to implement **XGBoost** in combination with GridSearch to boost our algorithms. We will also filter out outliers and break down at product levels.
  - And let's try to implement the same dataset using **Facebook's Prophet, ARIMA and LSTM**.
